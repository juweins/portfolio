# About this Repository

This repository contains some showcase projects for my personal branding. I am a software developer and I am passionate about programming. I am also a big fan of open source software and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills. Currently, I am returning to Software Engineering after a personal break where I studied horticultural engineering. 

Please do not hesitate to provide feedback. Suggestions, questions or comments? Feel free to contact me!

## Projects
All of my currently available projects are listed below. The projects **do not** have a specific order, nor do I try to use as many technologies as possible. I am trying to showcase my skills in a way that is easy to understand,fun to read and may expand your knowledge.

### **001 - Event Stream Processing**
In this project, I am using Apache Kafka to ingest data from an API into my Azure Account. The API is a free API from APIlayer. I chose to use a exchange rate API to simulate a real-world use case in which one would like to ingest a unsteady, but continuous stream of data. The data gets processed by a simple Kafka cluster on a azure VM.
I chose to code it in ü¶ÄRust, since I am currently expanding my knowledge besides üêçPython (main) and ‚òïJava.
